#this script will:
#1 import the sequences.csv file
#2 count the numbers of each base pair in each sequence
#3 print each sequence
#4 print out the number of each nt as a table
#5 include an image of a bacteria
#6 link to the wikipedia article on Borrelia burgdorferi
#7 caluculate %gc content and print in a table
#8 add headers to distinguish the tables from the seq analysis, and use subheaders for the 3 seqs
#9 create a scatterplot based on gc content from GC_content.csv (calculate %gc first), distinguish all 3 species as clearly as possible

#read the csv for the data.
library(knitr)
Seq=read.csv("Sequences.csv")
#this command removes all supplimentary info from the sequences, leaving us with purely the nucleotides
PureSeq=paste(gsub(">.*: ","",Seq$x))

#The following commands count the number of each type of (naming conventions: Pure Sequence As = PSA)
#nucleotide in each sequnce by removing everything from the sequnce except for that type of nucleotide
#additionally, the Names obj contains all of the names of the nucleotides

PSA=nchar(gsub(">.*: |*[^A]","",Seq$x))

###`r paste(Names[1])`
```{r echo = F}
print(PureSeq[1])
#using paste instead of print seems to result in a straight line of letters, removing legability.
```



###`r paste(Names[2])`
```{r echo = F}
print(PureSeq[2])
```

###`r paste(Names[3])`

```{r echo = F}
print(PureSeq[3])
```
